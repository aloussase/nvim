# nvim

This is my chad nvim config for programming gods.

## Installation

For Linux:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aloussase/nvim
mv nvim ~/.config/
```

After that you can open neovim and plugins will be installed via the Lazy
package manager.

For configuration and default keybindings, take a look at this repository's
wiki page.
